MemMap application:

--Software Architecture--
Database: Firebase
Language: Swift 4.0
Software:  ARKit, iOS 12

--Project Description--
This software is a map application that saves images taken based on geographic location.
It's a mapping of memories taken at a location. This application saves images you take and 
pins them on the map so you know where you took the images.
When the same location is visited, you will be able to see floating AR objects exactly where you took the images.
These floating objects, once tapped, will allow you to view the image you took previously.

How to use:
- Clone project
- Run application on mobile device (iOS)
- You can register and login to the application using an email/passcode combination.
- Once logged in, a three-tabbed view will welcome you. The default screen is the camera view, and two others 
are the map view and an explore view.
- On the camera view, you can take pictures as you wish and save them using the plus button on the top right corner
of the screen, you can also add comments on the pictures you take before saving them.
- Once you've saved pictures, you can visit the map view or explore view and see the new additions to the screens.
On the map view, you will see new pins added on the location points where images have been taken.
On the explore view, you will see floating AR objects where the images have been taken (if you're at the same location you took them).
- The floating AR objects, once tapped, will show you the images you took at that same spot.
- A log out button is present on the camera view and explore view if you wish to be logged out of the application for another user.
